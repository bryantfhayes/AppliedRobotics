Been messing around with template matching. Could use multiple templates to
capture various images of fish and eventually be able to place bounding boxes
around every fish on the board. This wont however let us know where the
keypoints are, or if a fishes mouth is open. We could try and only use opened
mouth fishes as templates, but we risk the issue of thinking a fish mouth is
open, when really it is not.

We also need to think about delay. If we find the keypoint, it isnt going to
move, but if we try and go to a fish with an open mouth, we would go there and
it would already be gone. We should go after keypoints and camp there until
there are no more fish.
